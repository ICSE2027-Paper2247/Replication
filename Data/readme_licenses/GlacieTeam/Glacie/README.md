# What is Glacie?
Glacie is a mod that allows players to seamlessly connect to servers running a different version from their client-eliminating issues where version mismatches would normally prevent joining.

In essence, Glacie acts as a translator by converting differences in data packets between various versions, enabling players on different versions to connect to the server.

# Server Mod Loader
- Currently, we support [**LeviLamina**](https://github.com/LiteLDev/LeviLamina) and [**Endstone**](https://github.com/EndstoneMC/endstone) mod loader.
- If you don't know which one to choose, [**LeviLamina**](https://github.com/LiteLDev/LeviLamina) is recommended.

# Dependence
### **Glacie** requires [**ProtocolLib**](https://github.com/GlacieTeam/ProtocolLib) to be installed as a prerequisite in order to function properly.

# Installation
## LeviLamina
- Lip
```bash
lip install github.com/GlacieTeam/Glacie
```
## Endstone
- Download the release and unzip the zip package, then put the `Glacie.dll` into the plugins folder

## Client (Optional)
- Download the release and unzip the zip package, the click `LaunchMinecraft.bat` to inject `Glacie.dll` into the client.

# Precautions
- If you are using [**Endstone**](https://github.com/EndstoneMC/endstone) mod loader, you must set `block-network-ids-are-hashes=true` in `server.properties` manually (the default value is `true`), otherwise players from different versions will not be able to see any blocks.
> We highly recommend using [**LeviLamina**](https://github.com/LiteLDev/LeviLamina) mod loader instead.

# Supported Clients
- Depends on [**ProtocolLib**](https://github.com/GlacieTeam/ProtocolLib)
